"DO NOT FORGET US" License

Introduction

The "DO NOT FORGET US" License is a *fun* license I (Thomas Triskell Abot) created, it does not represent a true legal license. **Do not use this license to protect your work.** It only represents the behavior you wish others forkers to follow. You can use it the way you want and modify it freely.  
**I could not be liable for any problem related to the use of this license.**
